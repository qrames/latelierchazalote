This directory will allow you to change the css stylesheet of the administration page.

First create simplehosting.css file in the customadmin directory.
Then import the current css by adding: `@import "/css/screen-default.css";` then redefine all the css rules you need.

You can also redefine the favicon.ico file by adding your own version to the customadmin directory.
